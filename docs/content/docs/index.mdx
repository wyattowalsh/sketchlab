# Sketchlab Documentation

Welcome to the Sketchlab documentation site. Here you will find all the information you need to get started with Sketchlab, a cross-platform desktop IDE for p5.js sketches.

## Table of Contents
1. [API Guide](api-guide.mdx)
2. [Plugin SDK](plugin-sdk.mdx)

## Overview
Sketchlab is a cross-platform desktop IDE for p5.js sketches, combining the ease of the official Web Editor with the power of a native Electron app. The app leverages React (with TypeScript) for UI, integrates the Monaco Editor for code authoring, and delivers an offline-first, plugin-driven workflow tailored for artists, educators, and creative coders.

## Features
- **Real-time Sketch Preview**: Instant canvas updates on code changes
- **Robust Code Authoring**: Monaco Editor with TypeScript support, linting, IntelliSense
- **Project & Asset Management**: Local file-system integration, drag-and-drop assets, project templates
- **Extensible Plugin Framework**: Dynamic plugin loading, UI hooks, and asset pipelines
- **Seamless Version Control**: p5.js version switching via npm or CDN
- **Cross-Platform Packaging**: Single installer for Windows, macOS, Linux with auto-updates
- **Offline Documentation**: Bundled API reference and example galleries
